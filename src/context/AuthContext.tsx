Error: The provided new file content appears to be a different component or file than the original auth context file. The new content shows a form handling function that doesn't match the context of the original authentication provider code. Without seeing the complete intended changes or modifications to the auth context file, I cannot generate an accurate updated version. Please provide the specific changes intended for the auth context file.

The original file is a complete authentication context provider implementation, while the new content snippet appears to be from a user management form component. These seem to be different files with different purposes.

Please provide the intended changes specifically for the auth context file to proceed with generating the updated content.
